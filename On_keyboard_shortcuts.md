#### Multi-Cursor Editing: 

1. Select multiple lines with multiple cursors:

Press Ctrl + D (Windows/Linux) or ```Cmd + D``` (macOS) to select the next occurrence of that word. Continue pressing Ctrl + D or Cmd + D to add more cursors for the same word in different lines.
This is useful for quick editing of repeated words or variable names across different lines.

3. Select multiple lines vertically:
Place the cursor on a line.
Press Shift + Alt + Down Arrow or Shift + Alt + Up Arrow (Windows/Linux).
On macOS, use ```Cmd + Option + Down Arrow``` or ```Cmd + Option + Up Arrow```.

4. Select all occurrences of the current word:
Place the cursor on a word.
Press Ctrl + Shift + L (Windows/Linux) or ```Cmd + Shift + L``` (macOS) to select all instances of that word throughout the document and create multiple cursors.
This is useful when you want to edit all occurrences of a word simultaneously.
